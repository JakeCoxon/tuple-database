## TODO

- game counter app with history...

- play with more triplestore ergonomics, order value, proxy objects.
	keep it simple for now though, no need to EXPLAIN or baked in indexes yet.

- types for ScanArgs with min/max for scanning..

- use reactive-magic strategy for composing queries more naturally.
	- get reactivity?

### Sometime Maybe
- Readable CSV FileStorage that isnt a cache.
- proper abstraction for encoding/decoding objects, with `prototype.{compare, serialize, deserialize}`
- compound sort directions?
