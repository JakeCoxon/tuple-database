## TODO

- more triplestore ergonomics
- game counter with history...

- {key, value} object so that it isnt a valid tuple for the key.
- types for ScanArgs with min/max for scanning..

- use reactive-magic strategy for composing queries more naturally.
	- get reactivity?

- Readable CSV FileStorage that isnt a cache.

### Later:
- proper abstraction for encoding/decoding objects, with `prototype.{compare, serialize, deserialize}`
- compound sort directions?
- Better raw file format that feels more readable / accessible?
