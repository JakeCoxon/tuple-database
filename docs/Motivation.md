# Example 1: Indexing Many-to-many Relationships











### What do I want you to learn?

- This is database stores ordered tuples. Heavily inspired by FoundationDb.
- There's a type schema in TypeScript.
- You can define mutations in this transaction thing.
- You can use this abstraction for simple things, like a game score counter.
- Or complex things like an end user database. Or a social app.


Benefits over others...
- transactional composition
- reactivity
- typescript types /schemas
- subspace composition.
